## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **OpenAI API Key:**
    *   Click the extension icon to access the options.
    *   Enter your OpenAI API key (available at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

2.  **Customize Options:**
    *   Choose the display mode (active area or dialog box).
    *   Configure the color, opacity, and display duration of the status banner.
    *   Select the languages for transcription (voice input) and for the text display.
    *   Enable or disable the translation functionality according to your needs.

3.  **(Optional) Use with LiteLLM Proxy:**
    *   Enable "Expert Mode" in the options.
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, modify **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance. **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable request logging by LiteLLM.

## üöÄ Use with LiteLLM Proxy

If you wish to use language models other than OpenAI, you can use LiteLLM Proxy. Here is how to configure it:

Babel Fish AI is compatible with [LiteLLM Proxy](https://litellm.ai/), which allows the use of alternative language models with an API compatible with that of OpenAI.

### Configuration

1.  **Install and set up LiteLLM Proxy:** Follow the instructions on the LiteLLM website.
2.  **Configure the Babel Fish AI extension:**
    *   In the extension options (right-click the icon > Options), enable "Expert Mode".
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, modify **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance (for example, `http://localhost:4000/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions`). **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable request logging by LiteLLM.

**Important:** The "NoLog" option is designed **exclusively** for use with LiteLLM Proxy. **Do not activate it** if you are using the official OpenAI API, as this will cause an error and prevent translation from working.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Functionality

### Extension Architecture

The extension is composed of several JavaScript files that interact with each other:

#### Main Files

*   **`manifest.json`:** The main configuration file of the extension. It defines permissions, scripts, accessible resources, etc. It uses Manifest Version 3 and declares permissions `activeTab`, `storage`, `commands`, `scripting`, and `contextMenus`.
*   **`background.js`:** The service worker that runs in the background. It handles events (clicking the icon, keyboard shortcuts, context menu), injects the `content script` if needed, and communicates with the `content script`.
*   **`content.js`:** The main script that is injected into web pages. It coordinates various utility modules and manages the overall flow of the extension.
*   **`src/constants.js`:** Defines constants for configuration, states, actions, etc.

#### Utility Modules

The extension uses a modular architecture with several specialized utility files:

##### API Management and Data Processing

*   **`src/utils/api.js`:** Contains functions to interact with the APIs, notably `transcribeAudio` to call OpenAI's Whisper API.
*   **`src/utils/api-utils.js`:** Advanced functions for interacting with external APIs.
*   **`src/utils/translation.js`:** Contains the functions `translateText` and `rephraseText` to call OpenAI's GPT API.
*   **`src/utils/text-translation.js`:** Specialized functions for text translation and rephrasing.
*   **`src/utils/text-processing.js`:** General text processing functions.

##### User Interface and Interaction

*   **`src/utils/ui.js`:** General utility functions for the user interface.
*   **`src/utils/banner-utils.js`:** Manages the status banner, its controls, and the language selector.
*   **`src/utils/focus-utils.js`:** Manages saving and restoring focus and text selection.
*   **`src/utils/transcription-display.js`:** Manages the display of transcription results.
*   **`src/utils/error-utils.js`:** Handles the display and processing of errors.
*   **`src/styles/content.css`:** CSS styles for the user interface injected into web pages.

##### Recording and Events

*   **`src/utils/recording-utils.js`:** Manages audio recording via the microphone and the processing of audio data.
*   **`src/utils/event-handlers.js`:** Contains event handlers for user interactions.

##### Internationalization and Languages

*   **`src/utils/languages.js`:** Defines the languages supported by the extension.
*   **`src/utils/languages-shared.js`:** Defines the list of supported languages for the web page context.
*   **`src/utils/languages-data.js`:** Defines the list of supported languages for the service worker.
*   **`src/utils/i18n.js`:** Manages internationalization for the user interface.

##### Options Page

*   **`src/pages/options/`:** Contains the files for the extension's options page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Transcription and Translation Process

#### Main Voice Transcription Feature

1.  **Start Recording:** The user starts recording by clicking the extension icon or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+1 or ‚åò+Shift+1 on Mac). The `background script` sends a message to the `content script` to start recording.
2.  **Audio Capture:** The `content script` uses the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access the microphone and record audio via the MediaRecorder API.
3.  **Transcription:** The `content script` uses the `transcribeAudio` function (`src/utils/api.js`) to send the audio to OpenAI's Whisper API. The API returns the transcribed text.
4.  **Translation or Rephrasing (Optional):**
   - If the translation option is enabled, the `content script` uses the `translateText` function (`src/utils/translation.js`) to send the transcribed text to OpenAI's GPT API.
   - If the rephrasing option is enabled, the `rephraseText` function is used to improve the transcribed text.
5.  **Display:** The `content script` displays the processed text either in the active element of the page (if it is a text field or editable element) or in a custom dialog box.

#### Context Menu Feature

1. **Text Selection:** The user selects text on a web page.
2. **Context Menu:** A right-click displays the options "Rephrase selection" or "Translate selection" with a submenu of available languages.
3. **Processing:** Depending on the chosen option:
   - The text is sent for rephrasing via the `rephraseText` function.
   - The text is sent for translation via the `translateText` function with the selected target language.
4. **Display:** The result replaces the original selection in the element where the selected text is located.

### Communication

Communication between the `background script` and the `content script` is done via Chrome's messaging API (`chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`).

### Data Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store:

*   The OpenAI API key (`apiKey`).
*   The extension options (display, translation, banner colors, etc.).
*   The language preferences for translation.

This data is stored locally on your computer, in the Chrome extension storage.

### Error Handling
Possible errors (missing API key, transcription error, etc.) are defined in the `constants.js` file. The `api.js` and `translation.js` functions handle potential errors from the API calls. The `content.js` displays error messages to the user via a banner at the top of the page.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection:**
  - The API key is securely stored in Chrome.
  - The extension does not store your audio data; all processing is done in real time.
  - Communication with the APIs is done via secure HTTPS connections.

For complete information on how BabelFishAI handles your data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Issues:**
  - Check microphone access permissions in Chrome.
  - Ensure that no other application is using the microphone simultaneously.

- **Transcription/Translation Errors:**
  - Verify that the API key is valid and active.
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
  - Check the Chrome console for detailed logs in case of an error.
