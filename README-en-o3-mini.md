## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Operation

- **Extension Architecture:**
  - **Manifest V3:** The `manifest.json` file defines the content scripts, the service worker (`background.js`), and the necessary permissions.
  - **Background and Content Scripts:** The `background.js` file handles background logic and communication with the APIs, while `content.js` deals with interaction with the active web page.
  - **Utilities and Internationalization:** The `src/utils` folder contains modules to manage the API, the user interface, the translation, and internationalization via language files in the `_locales` folder.

- **Transcription and Translation Process:**
  1. **Starting the Recording:** The extension captures your voice via the microphone when you click the icon or use the keyboard shortcut.
  2. **Transcription:** The audio is sent to OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper API to be converted into text, with support for multiple input languages.
  3. **Translation (Optional):** If activated, the transcription is automatically translated into the selected target language, while preserving meaning and context.
  4. **Display:** The transcribed (and optionally translated) text is inserted into the active field or displayed in a customized dialog window.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection:**
  - The API key is securely stored in Chrome.

  - Communication with the APIs is done via secure HTTPS connections.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Issues:**
