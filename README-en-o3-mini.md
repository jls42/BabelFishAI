## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Download and Installation:**
    - Clone this repository from GitHub or manually download the extension folder.
    - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Enable ‚ÄúDeveloper Mode‚Äù at the top right.
    - Click on ‚ÄúLoad unpacked‚Äù and select the Babel Fish AI folder.

2.  **Verification:**
    - Ensure that the extension appears in the Chrome toolbar with the custom icon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **OpenAI API Key:**
    *   Click on the extension icon to access the options.
    *   Enter your OpenAI API key (available at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

2.  **Customization of Options:**
    *   Choose the display mode (active area or dialog box).
    *   Configure the color, opacity, and display duration of the status bar.
    *   Select the languages for transcription (voice input) and for text display.
    *   Enable or disable the translation feature as needed.

3.  **(Optional) Use with LiteLLM Proxy:**
    *   Enable ‚ÄúExpert Mode‚Äù in the options.
    *   In the ‚ÄúAdvanced Configuration‚Äù section, modify **both URLs** of the APIs (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance. **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the option ‚ÄúNoLog (LiteLLM only)‚Äù if you wish to disable query logging by LiteLLM.

## üöÄ Use with LiteLLM Proxy

Babel Fish AI is compatible with [LiteLLM Proxy](https://litellm.ai/), which allows you to use alternative language models with an API compatible with that of OpenAI.

### Configuration

1.  **Install and configure LiteLLM Proxy:** Follow the instructions on the LiteLLM website.
2.  **Configure the Babel Fish AI extension:**
    *   In the extension options (right-click on the icon > Options), enable ‚ÄúExpert Mode.‚Äù
    *   In the ‚ÄúAdvanced Configuration‚Äù section, modify **both URLs** of the APIs (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance (for example, `http://localhost:4000/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions`). **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the option ‚ÄúNoLog (LiteLLM only)‚Äù if you wish to disable query logging by LiteLLM.

**Important:** The ‚ÄúNoLog‚Äù option is designed **exclusively** to be used with LiteLLM Proxy. **Do not enable it** if you are using the official OpenAI API, as this will result in an error and prevent translation from working.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Operation

### Extension Architecture

The extension is composed of several JavaScript files that interact with each other:

*   **`manifest.json`:** The main configuration file of the extension. It defines permissions, scripts, accessible resources, etc. It uses manifest version 3 and declares the permissions `activeTab`, `storage`, `commands`, and `scripting`. The `content_scripts` are injected into all URLs and run at the end of the document loading.
*   **`background.js`:** The service worker that runs in the background. It manages events (click on the icon, keyboard shortcuts), injects the `content script` if necessary, and communicates with the `content script`.
*   **`content.js`:** The script that is injected into web pages. It directly interacts with the DOM, captures audio from the microphone, calls the transcription and translation APIs, and displays the results.
*   **`src/utils/api.js`:** Contains the `transcribeAudio` function to call OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper API (transcription).
*   **`src/utils/translation.js`:** Contains the `translateText` function to call OpenAI‚Äôs GPT API (translation).
*   **`src/utils/ui.js`:** Contains utility functions to manage the user interface (banner, dialog box, copy button).
*   **`src/constants.js`:** Defines constants for configuration, states, actions, etc.
*   **`src/pages/options/`:** Contains the files for the extension‚Äôs options page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Transcription and Translation Process

1.  **Start Recording:** The user starts recording by clicking on the extension icon or using the keyboard shortcut. The `background script` sends a message to the `content script` to start recording.
2.  **Audio Capture:** The `content script` uses the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access the microphone and record the audio.
3.  **Transcription:** The `content script` uses the `transcribeAudio` function (`src/utils/api.js`) to send the audio to OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper API. The API returns the transcribed text.
4.  **Translation (Optional):** If the translation option is enabled, the `content script` uses the `translateText` function (`src/utils/translation.js`) to send the transcribed text to OpenAI‚Äôs GPT API. The API returns the translated text.
5.  **Display:** The `content script` displays the transcribed (and optionally translated) text either in the active element of the page (if it is a text field or an editable element) or in a dialog box.

### Communication

The communication between the `background script` and the `content script` is done via Chrome‚Äôs messaging API (`chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`).

### Data Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store:

*   The OpenAI API key (`apiKey`).
*   The extension options (display, translation, status bar colors, etc.).

### Error Management

Possible errors (missing API key, transcription error, etc.) are defined in the `constants.js` file. The functions in `api.js` and `translation.js` handle potential errors from the API calls. The `content.js` displays error messages to the user via a banner at the top of the page.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection:**
  - The API key is securely stored in Chrome.
  - The extension does not retain your audio data; all processing is done in real time.
  - Communication with the APIs is conducted via secure HTTPS connections.

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Issues:**
  - Check microphone access permissions in Chrome.
  - Ensure that no other application is using the microphone simultaneously.

- **Transcription/Translation Errors:**
  - Verify that the API key is valid and active.
  - Ensure you have a stable internet connection.
  - Check the Chrome console for detailed logs in case of an error.
