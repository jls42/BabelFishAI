# Babel Fish AI - Voice Transcription and Translation Extension with AI

<img src="images/icon128.png" alt="Babel Fish AI Icon" width="128" height="128">

**To use the extension, you will need an OpenAI API key (or a third-party provider if you are using LiteLLM Proxy). You can generate an OpenAI API key here: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)**

Babel Fish AI is an innovative Chrome extension originally designed to offer powerful voice transcription. Transform your voice into text with remarkable accuracy using the OpenAI Whisper API, and optionally benefit from real-time automatic translation. You can use Babel Fish AI exclusively for transcription or enable on-the-fly translation according to your needs.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Download and Installation:**
    - Clone this repository from GitHub or manually download the extension folder.
    - **Or install the extension directly from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/babelfishai-by-jls42org/aahodplbenfmijbeahnhoklpdnmfdmbk)**
    - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Enable "Developer mode" at the top right.
    - Click on "Load unpacked" and select the Babel Fish AI folder.

2.  **Verification:**
    - Ensure that the extension appears in the Chrome toolbar with the custom icon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **OpenAI API Key:**
    *   Click on the extension icon to access the options.
    *   Enter your OpenAI API Key (available at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

2.  **Customization of Options:**
    *   Choose the display mode (active area or dialog box).
    *   Configure the color, opacity, and display duration of the status banner.
    *   Select the languages for transcription (voice input) and for text display.
    *   Enable or disable the translation functionality according to your needs.

3.  **(Optional) Use with LiteLLM Proxy:**
    *   Activate "Expert Mode" in the options.
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, modify **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance. **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable request logging by LiteLLM.

## üöÄ Use with LiteLLM Proxy

If you want to use language models other than OpenAI, you can use LiteLLM Proxy. Here's how to configure it:

Babel Fish AI is compatible with [LiteLLM Proxy](https://litellm.ai/), which allows the use of alternative language models with an API compatible with that of OpenAI.

### Configuration

1.  **Install and configure LiteLLM Proxy:** Follow the instructions on the LiteLLM website.
2.  **Configure the Babel Fish AI extension:**
    *   In the extension options (right-click on the icon > Options), activate "Expert Mode".
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, modify **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance (for example, `http://localhost:4000/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions`). **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable request logging by LiteLLM.

**Important:** The "NoLog" option is designed **exclusively** for use with LiteLLM Proxy. **Do not activate it** if you are using the official OpenAI API, as it will cause an error and prevent translation from working.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Operation

### Extension Architecture

The extension is composed of several JavaScript files that interact with each other:

*   **`manifest.json`:** The main configuration file of the extension. It defines the permissions, scripts, accessible resources, etc. It uses Manifest version 3 and declares the permissions `activeTab`, `storage`, `commands`, `scripting` and `contextMenus`. The `web_accessible_resources` allow access to the extension resources in the various execution contexts.
*   **`background.js`:** The service worker that runs in the background. It manages events (click on the icon, keyboard shortcuts, context menu), injects the content script if necessary, and communicates with the content script.
*   **`content.js`:** The script that is injected into web pages. It interacts directly with the DOM, captures audio from the microphone, calls the transcription and translation APIs, and displays the results.
*   **`src/utils/api.js`:** Contains functions to interact with the APIs, notably `transcribeAudio` to call the OpenAI Whisper API (transcription) and utility functions to manage storage.
*   **`src/utils/translation.js`:** Contains the `translateText` and `rephraseText` functions to call the OpenAI GPT API (translation and rephrasing).
*   **`src/utils/ui.js`:** Contains utility functions to manage the user interface (banner, dialog box, copy button).
*   **`src/utils/languages-shared.js` and `src/utils/languages-data.js`:** Define the centralized list of supported languages, respectively for the web page context and for the service worker.
*   **`src/utils/i18n.js`:** Manages internationalization for the user interface.
*   **`src/constants.js`:** Defines constants for configuration, states, actions, etc.
*   **`src/pages/options/`:** Contains the files for the extension options page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Transcription and Translation Process

#### Main Voice Transcription Feature

1.  **Starting the Recording:** The user starts the recording by clicking on the extension icon or using the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+1 or ‚åò+Shift+1 on Mac). The background script sends a message to the content script to start the recording.
2.  **Audio Capture:** The content script uses the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access the microphone and record audio via the MediaRecorder API.
3.  **Transcription:** The content script uses the `transcribeAudio` function (`src/utils/api.js`) to send the audio to the OpenAI Whisper API. The API returns the transcribed text.
4.  **Translation or Rephrasing (Optional):** 
   - If the translation option is enabled, the content script uses the `translateText` function (`src/utils/translation.js`) to send the transcribed text to the OpenAI GPT API.
   - If the rephrasing option is enabled, the `rephraseText` function is used to improve the transcribed text.
5.  **Display:** The content script displays the processed text either in the active element on the page (if it is a text field or an editable element) or in a custom dialog box.

#### Context Menu Feature

1. **Text Selection:** The user selects text on a web page.
2. **Context Menu:** A right-click displays the options "Rephrase selection" or "Translate selection" with a submenu of the available languages.
3. **Processing:** Depending on the chosen option:
   - The text is sent for rephrasing via the `rephraseText` function.
   - The text is sent for translation via the `translateText` function with the selected target language.
4. **Display:** The result replaces the original selection in the element where the text was selected.

### Communication

Communication between the background script and the content script is done via the Chrome messaging API (`chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`).

### Data Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store:

*   The OpenAI API key (`apiKey`).
*   The extension options (display, translation, banner colors, etc.).
*   The language preferences for translation.

These data are stored locally on your computer in the Chrome extension storage.

### Error Handling
Possible errors (missing API key, transcription error, etc.) are defined in the `constants.js` file. The `api.js` and `translation.js` functions handle potential errors from the API calls. The `content.js` displays error messages to the user via a banner at the top of the page.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection:**
  - The API key is securely stored in Chrome.
  - The extension does not retain your audio data; all processing is done in real-time.
  - Communication with the APIs is done via secure HTTPS connections.

For complete information on how BabelFishAI handles your data, please refer to our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Issues:**
  - Check microphone access permissions in Chrome.
  - Ensure that no other application is using the microphone simultaneously.

- **Transcription/Translation Errors:**
  - Verify that the API key is valid and active.
  - Make sure you have a stable internet connection.
  - Check the Chrome console for detailed logs in case of an error.
