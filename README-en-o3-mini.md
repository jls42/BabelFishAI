# Babel Fish AI - AI Voice Transcription and Translation Extension

**To use the extension, you will need an OpenAI API key (or a third-party provider if you are using LiteLLM Proxy). You can generate an OpenAI API key here: [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)**

Babel Fish AI is an innovative Chrome extension originally designed to offer powerful voice transcription. Transform your voice into text with remarkable accuracy thanks to OpenAI's Whisper API, and optionally benefit from real-time automatic translation. You can use Babel Fish AI exclusively for transcription or enable on-the-fly translation based on your needs.

    - Possibility to customize the transcription and translation models.
    - Compatibility with LiteLLM Proxy to connect to alternative language models and disable request logging.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Download and Installation:**
    - Clone this repository from GitHub or manually download the extension folder.
    - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    - Enable "Developer Mode" in the top right.
    - Click "Load unpacked extension" and select the Babel Fish AI folder.

2.  **Verification:**
    - Ensure that the extension appears in the Chrome toolbar with the custom icon.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

1.  **OpenAI API Key:**
    *   Click on the extension icon to access the options.
    *   Enter your OpenAI API key (available at [platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

2.  **Customization of Options:**
    *   Choose the display mode (active field or dialog box).
    *   Configure the color, opacity, and display duration of the status banner.
    *   Select the languages for transcription (voice input) and for text display.
    *   Enable or disable the translation feature according to your needs.

3.  **(Optional) Use with LiteLLM Proxy:**
    *   Enable "Expert Mode" in the options.
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, change **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance. **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable logging of requests by LiteLLM.

## üöÄ Use with LiteLLM Proxy

If you wish to use language models other than OpenAI, you can use LiteLLM Proxy. Here‚Äôs how to configure it:

Babel Fish AI is compatible with [LiteLLM Proxy](https://litellm.ai/), which allows the use of alternative language models with an API compatible with OpenAI's.

### Configuration

1.  **Install and configure LiteLLM Proxy:** Follow the instructions on the LiteLLM website.
2.  **Configure the Babel Fish AI extension:**
    *   In the extension options (right-click on the icon > Options), enable "Expert Mode".
    *   In the "Advanced Configuration" section, change **both API URLs** (Whisper and Translation) to point to your LiteLLM Proxy instance (for example, `http://localhost:4000/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions`). **Use the same base URL for both.**
    *   Check the "NoLog (LiteLLM only)" option if you wish to disable logging of requests by LiteLLM.

**Important:** The "NoLog" option is designed **exclusively** for use with LiteLLM Proxy. **Do not enable it** if you are using the official OpenAI API, as this will cause an error and prevent translation from working.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Operation

### Extension Architecture

The extension is composed of several JavaScript files that interact with each other:

*   **`manifest.json`:** The main configuration file for the extension. It defines the permissions, scripts, accessible resources, etc. It uses manifest version 3 and declares the permissions `activeTab`, `storage`, `commands`, and `scripting`. The `content_scripts` are injected into all URLs and executed at the end of the document loading.
*   **`background.js`:** The service worker that runs in the background. It handles events (clicking on the icon, keyboard shortcuts), injects the content script if necessary, and communicates with the content script.
*   **`content.js`:** The script that is injected into web pages. It directly interacts with the DOM, captures audio from the microphone, calls the transcription and translation APIs, and displays the results.
*   **`src/utils/api.js`:** Contains the `transcribeAudio` function to call OpenAI's Whisper API (transcription).
*   **`src/utils/translation.js`:** Contains the `translateText` function to call OpenAI's GPT API (translation).
*   **`src/utils/ui.js`:** Contains utility functions to manage the user interface (banner, dialog box, copy button).
*   **`src/constants.js`:** Defines constants for configuration, states, actions, etc.
*   **`src/pages/options/`:** Contains the files for the extension's options page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Transcription and Translation Process

1.  **Starting the Recording:** The user starts the recording by clicking on the extension icon or using the keyboard shortcut. The background script sends a message to the content script to start recording.
2.  **Audio Capture:** The content script uses the `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia` API to access the microphone and record audio.
3.  **Transcription:** The content script uses the `transcribeAudio` function (`src/utils/api.js`) to send the audio to OpenAI's Whisper API. The API returns the transcribed text.
4.  **Translation (Optional):** If the translation option is enabled, the content script uses the `translateText` function (`src/utils/translation.js`) to send the transcribed text to OpenAI's GPT API. The API returns the translated text.
5.  **Display:** The content script displays the transcribed text (and optionally translated text) either in the active element on the page (if it is a text field or editable element) or in a dialog box.

### Communication

Communication between the background script and the content script is done via Chrome's messaging API (`chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.onMessage`).

### Data Storage

The extension uses `chrome.storage.sync` to store:

*   The OpenAI API key (`apiKey`).
*   The extension's options (display, translation, banner colors, etc.).

This data is stored locally on your computer, in Chrome's extension storage.

### Error Handling
Possible errors (missing API key, transcription error, etc.) are defined in the `constants.js` file. The functions in `api.js` and `translation.js` handle potential errors from API calls. The `content.js` displays error messages to the user via a banner at the top of the page.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Privacy

- **Data Protection:**
  - The API key is stored securely within Chrome.
  - The extension does not retain your audio data; all processing occurs in real time.
  - Communication with the APIs is secured via HTTPS connections.

For complete information on how BabelFishAI handles your data, please consult our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## üîß Troubleshooting

- **Microphone Problems:**
  - Check microphone access permissions in Chrome.
  - Ensure that no other application is using the microphone simultaneously.

- **Transcription/Translation Errors:**
  - Check that the API key is valid and active.
  - Ensure that you have a stable internet connection.
  - Check Chrome's console for detailed logs in case of error.
